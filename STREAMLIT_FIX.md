# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix

## Issue: "Error installing requirements"

### Solution Steps:

1. **Updated requirements.txt** - Simplified to use latest compatible versions
2. **Added packages.txt** - For system-level dependencies
3. **Updated config.toml** - Added deployment-specific settings
4. **Removed problematic imports** - Fixed opencv conflicts

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Simplified dependencies
- ✅ `packages.txt` - Added system packages
- ✅ `.streamlit/config.toml` - Updated configuration
- ✅ `src/image_utils.py` - Removed conflicting imports

### How to Deploy:

1. **Push these changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment requirements"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to your app dashboard
   - Click "Reboot app" or redeploy
   - The app should now install correctly

3. **If still having issues:**
   - Try using Python 3.9 in Streamlit Cloud settings
   - Clear the app cache and redeploy
   - Check the deployment logs for specific errors

### Alternative: Simple Local Test
```bash
# Test locally first
pip install streamlit google-generativeai Pillow numpy opencv-python-headless requests
streamlit run app.py
```

### Common Streamlit Cloud Issues:
- **Memory limits**: Large packages like opencv can cause memory issues
- **Build timeouts**: Complex dependencies may timeout
- **Version conflicts**: Pinned versions sometimes conflict

### This fix addresses:
- ✅ Simplified requirements to avoid version conflicts  
- ✅ Added system packages for opencv
- ✅ Removed problematic cv2 import
- ✅ Updated Streamlit configuration for deployment
