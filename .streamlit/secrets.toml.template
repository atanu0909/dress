# Streamlit Secrets Template
# Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml and add your actual API key

# For production deployment, add your API key here:
# GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"

# For local development, you can keep the API key in the code
# But for production deployment, use this secrets file instead
