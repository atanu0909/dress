## Configuration

The application uses Google Gemini AI for image analysis and processing. The API key is configured directly in the code for this demo version.

For production use, consider:
- Moving the API key to environment variables
- Adding user authentication
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding more sophisticated image generation capabilities

## Tips for Best Results

- Use high-quality, well-lit photos
- Ensure the person is facing forward in the photo
- Use dress images with clear, visible details
- Images should preferably be in portrait orientation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI Processing**: Google Gemini AI
