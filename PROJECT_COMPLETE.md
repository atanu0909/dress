## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Upload Images**: Users upload a photo of themselves and a dress image
2. **AI Processing**: Google Gemini AI analyzes both images
3. **Virtual Try-On**: AI generates a description and composite result
4. **Style Analysis**: Provides compatibility scoring and suggestions
5. **Download**: Users can save their virtual try-on results

## 🌐 Deployment Options
